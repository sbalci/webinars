Abstract:

For several years now, the plotly package has provided an `event_data()` function for accessing click, hover, and drag event information in shiny. This functionality provides a powerful way to build dynamic websites with multiple coordinated data views that share information with one another. Recently, we’ve added support for accessing more types of events, notably among these is ability to respond _during_ brushing events. In this webinar, I’ll show you how to access these events in shiny and respond to them in various ways, including approaches that help ensure a fluid and responsive user-experience.
