## Who is this webinar for?

### R Admin -- data scientists who want to do more

### R Evangelists

### IT/Ops

### Anyone who wants to try RStudio professional products

## RStudio

### RStudio empowers individuals to be productive with data science.

* Open source and reproducible research
* APIs and interoperability
* Usability and clear documentation
* Inclusive and collective success
* Creating lasting value for data science

## What we do

### RStudio builds open source and professional software for data science

* Our professional features include things like

    * Security
    * Authentication
    * Load balancing
    * Support

### RStudio professional products

## What is the relationship between R and RStudio?

### We donâ€™t own R, package R, or distribute R

### R Core team: 20 members -- Zero from RStudio

### RStudio products "sit on top of R"

  * You standardize on R first
  * Install our products second
  
### We assume you have chosen to invest in R

## Professional R tooling and integration

## Administering RStudio professional products

### People want to know if they are doing things the best way

* R is relatively unknown in most organizations
* No single place to get all the information you need
* Hard to see the forest through the trees

### We see a lot of trial and error

* Organizational hurdles
* Resource limitations

## Outline

### I want to share some best practices for managing RStudio in production

* Share product requirements
* Some tips
* A path for getting started

Goal is to give you a big picture view of what success looks like, assuming you are using RStudio professional products

# 5 Best practices for administering RStudio in production

## 1. Keep your system up to date

### Modern tools

  * Operating system
  * Browsers
    
### C++11 compiler

  * R packages on Linux must be compiled

### Internet access
  
  * R packages
    
## 2. Support multiple versions of R

### Why do you want to run multiple versions of R?

  * Manage upgrades of R
  * Test code on a variety of R versions and distributions
  * Support projects that depend on various versions of R
  * All products support multiple versions of R

### Upgrade yearly (version 3.1.0+)

### Build R from source

  * Multiple versions of R side by side requires you build R from source
  * Not hard to do (i.e. config/make/make install)
  * Most organizations have processes in place for building software
  * [Instructions](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002242413-Multiple-versions-of-R)

## 3. Organize your R packages

### R Packages rule the nest.

* Packages will drive your R version, Linux dependencies, and even your operating system
* Data scientists will want access to their most beloved packages

### Managing packages for a single user is easy. 

* Managing packages for an entire platform is hard

### RStudio Package Manager solves several problems

* Disconnected, air-gapped environments
* Serving containers with Docker
* Curate packages into multiple repositories for security and control
* Share internal packages

### RStudio Package Manager is new

* [Demo](https://demo.rstudiopm.com/client/#/)

## 4. Use root privileges

The group in your organization that installs, configures, and manages R and RStudio will need root privileges

### RStudio products

* Installs require root privileges
* Runs require root privileges
    * RStudio Server Pro runs as the root user in order to create new R sessions on behalf of its users
    * RStudio Connect runs as the root user in order to isolate applications and processes

### R

* System-wide installations of R on Linux often involve root also

## 5. Securely manage your users

### R programmers - RStudio Server Pro

* They will need access to R, file shares, databases, and probably many other sensitive systems.
* R processes run as the user under a local account

### End users - RStudio Connect

* End users consume apps and reports.
* R Processes typically run under a service account

## Authentication

### Your organization

* Probably has strong opinions on how to authenticate users
* This space is only getting more fragmented not less
    * LDAP, Active Directory, PAM, OAuth, Okta, Duo, Auth0, etc.

### Proxied authentication

* If we don't support your specific system, then you can use our proxied authentication
* With proxied auth, users do not log in through RStudio but through a proxy that you set up

## Supported Auth Methods

### RStudio Server Pro

* PAM (LDAP and Active Directory)
* OAuth 2.0 using Google Apps
* *Proxied authentication*

### RStudio Connect

* LDAP and Active Directory
* OAuth 2.0 using Google Apps
* PAM
* SAML [Beta]
* *Proxied authentication*

## Recommendations (your Happy path)

### 1. Keep your operating systems and browsers up to date

### 2. Plan to support multiple versions of R by building R from source

### 3. Organize your R packages for reliability and consistency

### 4. Use root privileges to install and run RStudio products

### 5. Securely manage your R programmers and end users

# Getting Started

## Tooling

### RStudio makes software tools that are designed to work together

* Our R packages and products work together
* There are many ways to assemble our tools
* But it will be up to you to decide how to do it
* Your configuration depends on what does data science means to your organization

Our goal is to make it easy to install and configure all of our products

## Solutions

### Data science lab

### Application factories (Dev/Test/Prod)

### On premises, cloud, hybrid cloud

### Single server or a multi-departmental deployment

### Crawl, walk, run strategies
